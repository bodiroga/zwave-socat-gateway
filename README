## Introduction

This project was built at Tknika to allow distributed ZWave networks in an openHAB installation. Plug a ZWave USB stick in your Raspberry Pi, place your Pi whenever you want, give it network connectivity and with the help of this script, you will be able to configure the ZWave binding as if the ZWave controller was physically connected to your server. To avoid any confusion, the Raspberry Pi where this script is executed is not where openHAB is installed, the machine running openHAB is called "the server".


## Installation

You don't even need to clone the repository to use this script, just download the install.sh file to your Raspberry Pi, execute it with root privileges, configure the CONFIGURATION with your requirements and reboot the Raspberry Pi. The script will automatically create a virtual serial port in your server.
