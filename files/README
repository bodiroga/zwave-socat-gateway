######################################## FILES TO EDIT #############################################

After executing the installation script, you need to edit the following files:

- CONFIGURATION (/root/CONFIGURATION)
Edit the fields that you want to meet your requirements:
CONNECTION_TYPE: Shows if the Raspberry pi is connected through WiFi or Ethernet cable to the network.
ZWAVE_NUMBER: Number of the ZWave network controlled by this Raspberry Pi. If you are going to use a single ZWave network,
              leave the "".
REFRESH_INTERVAL: How often (in seconds) you want to inform the server about the state of the Raspberry Pi.
ROOM_NAME: Name of the Raspberry Pi in the network.
SERVER_USER: Name of the server user to which we are going to connect through SSH.
SERVER_HOST: Hostname or IP address of the server to which we are going to connect through SSH.
ZWAVE_HOME: Path where the virtual USB port will be mounted in the server. For example: "/home/SERVER_USER/zwave".
            Change the SERVER_USER part only.
ZWAVE_STICK: Path where the ZWave USB device is mounted in the Raspberry Pi, don't change it ('udev' rule).

- hostaname (/etc/hostname)
Here you should only write the same name that you have chosen for the 'ROOM_NAME' field of the CONFIGURATION file.
You can also use the raspi-config command to change the hostname of the Raspberry Pi.

- SSH KEY (/root/.ssh/id_rsa)
(NOTE: The generation of the SSH keys must be done logged as the root user in the Raspberry Pi -sudo su-)
Create a couple of SSH keys (public and private) on the Raspberry (or create a couple for all the Raspberrys)
and copy the public key to your server, so that the Rasbperry can connect and interact with the server without
introducing the server's password. The easiest way to copy the public key is using the ssh-copy-id command.
